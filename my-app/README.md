# Terra City Builder Game

An interactive educational game built with Next.js that teaches about environmental impact and NASA's Terra satellite data.

## About

Build your own city and watch real-time environmental changes over 10 years. See how buildings, factories, trees, and renewable energy sources affect air quality, temperature, vegetation, energy balance, and atmosphere - all monitored through NASA's Terra satellite instruments.

## Features

- **Interactive City Building**: Drag and drop elements to build your city
- **Real-time Environmental Monitoring**: Track 5 key metrics using Terra satellite instruments:
  - MODIS - Vegetation monitoring
  - MOPITT - Air quality tracking
  - CERES - Energy balance measurement
  - ASTER - Temperature monitoring
  - MISR - Atmospheric analysis
- **10-Year Simulation**: Watch your city evolve and see the environmental impact
- **AI Climate Prediction**: Get AI-powered predictions about future climate changes
- **Educational**: Learn about NASA's Terra satellite and Earth observation
